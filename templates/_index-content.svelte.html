      <p>Republicans control the White House, both houses of Congress, plus trifectas in 26 states where they hold governorships and majorities in state legislative chambers — success they're looking to replicate in Minnesota this November.

      <p>But the GOP may be facing a Democratic wave this election cycle since midterms often go poorly for majority parties.</p>

      <p>However, Republicans remain competitive in statewide and Congressional races across Minnesota due to a variety of factors, including partisan voting trends, demographics and President Donald Trump’s lingering popularity among GOP voters.

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota has become more Republican</h2>
      <p>After decades as a reliable Democratic stronghold, Hillary Clinton only won Minnesota by about two points in 2016, one of the slimmest margins for a Democratic victory in the state's history.</p>

      <p>But Donald Trump's insurgent vote total in Minnesota isn't the only indicator that Minnesota has become more Republican.</p>

      <p>On a statewide level, Minnesota's Cook Partisan Voting Index has gradually moved from a strongly <span class='d4 legendary'>Democratic</span> lean to one that's almost evenly split between the two parties.</p>

      <p>The index compares average Democratic and Republican presidential vote shares in a state or congressional district to national numbers for the previous two elections.</p>

      <p>Being closer to an "even" score suggests Minnesota is less Democratic-leaning than in recent memory. It's transformed into a much more level playing field for the GOP, which is extremely consequential in <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-re-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921/">this year's midterm</a> where the governor's office, Attorney General, state Legislature and U.S. Congress are up for grabs.</p>

      <p>Voters in the suburbs — which may prove key in close congressional and legislative races — are somewhat split in their views on the president's job performance, providing some hope for Republicans to hang onto those seats.</p>

      <p>Polled likely voters in the northern part of the state and Iron Range have the highest regional approval of Trump, which may be helpful for congressional and legislative races there.</p>

      <p>If that approval for Trump's job as president translates into voter enthusiasm, it may help push Republican candidates past the finish line in competitive districts in greater Minnesota and the metro area.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota looks like Trump Country</h2>
      <p>When Republican voters turned out significantly for Donald Trump in 2016, 19 counties in greater Minnesota <span class="red3 legendary">flipped</span> to trending Republican despite favoring <span class="d4 legendary">Democrats</span> in 2012 and 2008.</p>

      <p>This falls into Republican voting patterns as Minnesota demographically resembles a lot of neighboring red states and regions sometimes referred to as "Trump Country."</p>

      <p>The <span class="legendary gray5">percentage of ballots split between parties</span> for Congressional and statewide races has declined overall the past two decades.</p>

      <p>This suggests voters have become more partisan, and areas that vote for Republicans or Democrats in one race are more likely to also elect other officials of those parties.</p>

      <p>If this partisan voting trend continues, that could bode well for the GOP in places like District One and District Eight, which vote Republican in statewide contests but have elected Democratic representatives for years with diminishing margins.</p>

      <p>And if districts are less likely to split their vote between parties, gubernatorial and senatorial races could also end up being closer in favor of Republicans.</p>
